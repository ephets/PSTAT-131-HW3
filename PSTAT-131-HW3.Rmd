**For this assignment, we will be using the *titanic* data set to predict which passengers would survive the Titanic shipwreck. First we will load the data into R from *data/titanic.csv*.**

```{r}
titanic <-read_csv("data/titanic.csv", show_col_types=FALSE)
head(titanic)
```
 **The variables *survived* and *pclass* are both categorical predictors not representative of a quantity, so they must be changed into factor variables.**

```{r}
titanic$survived <- factor(titanic$survived, ordered=)
titanic$pclass <- factor(titanic$pclass)
```
